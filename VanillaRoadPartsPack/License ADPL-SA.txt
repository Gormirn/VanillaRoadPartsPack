This mod is a copy of licensed models from Bohemia Interactive that has been licensed under ADPL-SA. These additional sets of roads when used with DayZ-Editor and DayZ-Editor-Loader will not cause texture issues with the baked roads throughout the map.

There have been no attempts to test any of these models with any other mod that has the ability to place objects. Results may vary.

Class-name prefix: rbldr_road easiest search for all usable roads.

Changes were made to many models. Specifically how road-terrain behavior works, and Y axis values. No changes done to their default texture paths. There is also a config set up for them to be used. Crude change-log included.
